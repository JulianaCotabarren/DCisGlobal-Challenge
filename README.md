## Introduction

- This project was part of a Frontend Developer Challenge, where the main goal was to improve the website of [DCisGlobal](https://dcisglobal.com/) and propose new features.

## Tech Stack

- React project with Vite.
- React-Router and Context.
- Form management and validation with React Hook Form.
- Styled-components and responsiveness.
- Other tools: React icons, Prettier, ESLint.

## Features improved

### General features

- Subtitles font color was changed in order to improve the user experience.
- The footer was improved with the inclusion of multiple links of interest to the user, thus making it easier for them to contact the company, learn in depth different aspects of it and be able to view the different social networks in a simple and quick way.
- Extensive text was re-arranged as a board section, with the addition of images that could be more visually attractive. This feature also improves the mobile user experience because it is more readable than extensive paragraphs.
- Validation of form inputs was included in order to avoid user's errors, such as including numbers in the Name input or emails without the correct format.

### New features

- In the DCisScouting section, a button was added that redirects to the DCisJobs page, where the user can see the different jobs that are open in the company.
- On the DCisJobs page the user can filter the jobs according to the hybrid/presential/remote modality.
- Additionally, the user can search for jobs by title and if the search returns no results the user will be allowed to return to the DCisScouting page.
